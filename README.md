# Revenue Analysis (2014-2021)

# Project Overview
This reposistory contains details relating to the analysis of combination of datasets relating to the revenue of a ficticious company from the year 2014 through to the year 2021. I worked on this project using power query to transform the various dataset and Power BI to visulize various insight from the working on the dataset. Working on this project helped me learn how to use Power Query for various data transformation process and Power BI for visulization, I also got to apply my knowledge of DAX while working with Power BI to derive and visulize various insights.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to firstly to help me apply practically my knowledge of the use of Power Query for data transformation, Power BI for data visulization and the use of DAX in creating various logical measures within Power BI.By applying apply all these, this project end goal is to visualize the answers to the following question on a Power BI interactive dashboard.

1. Total Revenue. 
2. Total number of Products. 
3. Total number of Manufactures. 
4. % of Urban Revenue.
5. Number of countries 
6. Total number of cities. 
7. Revenue trend by year and month. 
8. Top 5 Manufacturers By Revenue.
9. Top 10 Products By Revenue. 
10. Total Revenue By category. 
11. Total Revenue By Country. 
12. Segment, Revenue, and a Sparkline of revenue by product (Table Visual).

# Features
- Interactive Power BI dashboard with year, month and product slicers
- File that includes all the DAX formula used in creating different measure in Power BI
